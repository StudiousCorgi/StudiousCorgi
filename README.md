- 👋 Hi, I’m @StudiousCorgi
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about scriptwriting and working towards making my Child Friendly RPG.
- 🌱 I’ve grasped the basic foundations of front-end web building, currently working on JavaScript!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to help develope our own styls and integrate seemlessly when working together.
- 📫 How to reach me by email: Asia.Brown-Haller.mscoding@org
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learned about coding from a class utilizing 'Google sheets'. Once I realized how powerful the equations and functions were, I couldn't turn my curiosity off. I've been learning about "coding" ever since!
